## Project for Companies House role "Lead Test Engineer - Technical assessment"

### Background

As I'm sure you will have noted in my CV and PS, I don't have extensive experience in the specific disciplines that this test aims to probe - the creation of automated test code to perform QA on user interfaces.

My career has mostly been on back-end systems and therefore I'm far more familiar with API testing, over the years I have written and tested UIs (of various flavours) but I tended towards the development, rather than the QA side of the projects.

However, I've made an attempt at the task - using various AI Tooling products to give me a vaguely working starting point.

### What I've done

- Using CLAUDE I've created a structure in dir `restful-booker-tests` which demonstrates a working (though minimal) **Playwright & TypeScript** solution.

- The structure, and the unedited contents of several of the target files, can be seen in the file `playwright_directory_struture.md`

- I put together a basic document `Testing in general and the specific task.md` to collate a bunch of resources with which to do some research initially. 

- In `Test Plan - Restful Booker Platform.md` is a sample test plan for the entire QA process, encompassing all the aspects mentioned in the brief you provided.
